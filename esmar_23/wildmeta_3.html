# Dependence 

- Typical meta-analytic techniques (like meta-regression) involves the assumption that effect sizes are independent 

--

- However, common for each primary study to yield more than one effect size or studies to be nested in some way creating dependence 

--

- Example: Kalaian and Raudenbush (1996) data from `clubSandwich` with effects of SAT (US standardized test for college admissions) coaching 
  - 47 studies, 67 effect sizes
  - Effects in same study from math and verbal sections of the test

# Handling Dependence

- Ignoring dependence leads to incorrect standard errors, incorrect inference from hypothesis tests

--

- Robust variance estimation (RVE) with small sample correction recommended (Tipton, 2015; Tipton and Pustejovsky, 2015)

--
  
- Such correction controls Type 1 error rates adequately but low power especially for __multiple-contrast hypothesis tests__ (Joshi, Pustejovsky and Beretvas, 2022; Tipton and Pustejovsky, 2015)
  - Example of multiple contrast hypothesis test: To what extent do the effects of SAT coaching vary across math and verbal sections of the test?
  
---

# Cluster Wild Bootstrapping

- We examined an alternative method cluster wild bootstrapping (CWB) (Joshi, Pustejovsky and Beretvas, 2022)

--

- Bootstrapping involves estimating unknown quantities by re-sampling from original data many times (Boos et al., 2013)

--
  
- CWB involves re-sampling residuals by multiplying them by random cluster-level weights (Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller 2008)

--

- CWB maintains adequate Type 1 error rates and has more power than RVE small-sample correction (Joshi, Pustejovsky and Beretvas, 2022)

---

# CWB Algorithm

1. Fit a null model and a full model on the original data

--

2. Obtain residuals from the null model 

--

3. Generate an auxiliary random variable that has mean of 0 and variance of 1 and multiply the residuals by the random variable (e.g., Rademacher weights) set to be constant within clusters (CWB)
  
--

4.  Obtain new outcome scores by adding the transformed residuals to the predicted values from the null model fit on the original data

--

5.  Re-estimate the full model with the new calculated outcome scores and obtain the test statistic

--

6. Repeat steps 3-5 `\(R\)` times. Calculate p-value:

`$$p = \frac{1}{R} \sum_{r = 1}^R I\left(F^{(r)} &gt; F\right)$$`

# wildmeta

- The main function in the package is `Wald_test_cwb()`

- Works with meta-regressions models fit using `robumeta::robu()`, `metafor::rma.mv()` and `metafor::rma.uni()`


```r
Wald_test_cwb(
  full_model,
  constraints,
  R,
  cluster = NULL,
  auxiliary_dist = "Rademacher",
  adjust = "CR0",
  type = "CR0",
  test = "Naive-F",
  seed = NULL
)

# How Many Bootstraps?

- Higher number of bootstraps better ~ precision, power

--

- Computationally intensive

--

- 1,999 or higher

--

- See [Davidson &amp; MacKinnon (2000)](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/67820/1/587473266.pdf) for guidance on number of bootstraps
