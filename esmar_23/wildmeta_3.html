# Cluster Wild Bootstrapping (CWB)

- Dependent effect sizes common in meta-analyses
  
- Ignore dependence 
  - Incorrect standard errors, incorrect inference from hypothesis tests
  
- Using RVE (CR2 + Satterthwaite df) recommended but can result in low power especially for multiple contrast hypothesis tests

- CWB maintains Type 1 error rates and has more power than RVE (Joshi, Pustejovsky &amp; Beretvas, 2022)
  - CWB involves re-sampling residuals by multiplying them by cluster-level random weights (Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller 2008)

# wildmeta

- The main function in the package is `Wald_test_cwb()`

- Works with meta-regressions models fit using `robumeta::robu()`, `metafor::rma.mv()`, and `metafor::rma.uni()`


```r
Wald_test_cwb(
  full_model,
  constraints,
  R,
  cluster = NULL,
  auxiliary_dist = "Rademacher",
  adjust = "CR0",
  type = "CR0",
  test = "Naive-F",
  seed = NULL
)
```

# Example


---

# Tanner-Smith and Lipsey (2015)

- Tanner-Smith and Lipsey (2015) meta-analysis of the effects of brief alcohol interventions on alcohol consumption and behavior

  - 185 studies, 1446 effect sizes
    - Studies had multiple effect sizes
  - Multiple correlated outcome measures: e.g., alcohol consumption measured by frequency of consumption, quantity consumed, blood alcohol concentration
  - Repeated measures
  - Multiple comparison groups
  
- Example RQ:  Do effects of brief alcohol interventions differ across different outcome measurements?

# How Many Bootstraps?

- Higher number of bootstraps better ~ precision, power

- Computationally intensive

- 1,999 or higher

- See [Davidson &amp; MacKinnon (2000)](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/67820/1/587473266.pdf) for guidance on number of bootstraps
